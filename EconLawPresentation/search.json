["Zhitao Kou Dec 4th, 2018 Contract law Hewlett–Packard Company vs Oracle Corporation Court of Appeal, Sixth District, California (2015) Some background information: ● Hewlett–Packard (HP) developed Itanium with Intel, a new computing technology in hope to replace old architecture. Their attempt was unsuccessful, and HP had to limit Itanium products to business customers only. ● Oracle, along with Microsoft, RedHat and other companies, ported their software to Itanium platform. No specific end dates were discussed in the past, and HP never had to make further requests, payments for porting. ● Eventually, all companies announced end-of-life support for Itanium: RedHat (2009), Microsoft (2010), Oracle (2011), while promising support for existing customers. ● Unlike others, Oracle involved another contract case with HP. In 2010, Oracle acquired Sun Microsystems, becoming a direct competitor with HP. Later, Oracle hired former HP CEO Mark Hurd and violated his exit deal from HP (not a non-compete clause though). ● 2010, two companies settled and stated in writing: “Oracle will continue to offer its product suite on HP platforms... in a manner consistent with that partnership as it existed prior to Oracle's hiring of Hurd” ● “Oracle and H.P. will continue to build and expand a partnership that has already lasted for over 25 years” Some court issues: 2011: HP sued Oracle for breach of contract, decided by Superior Court of Santa Clara County. 2012: Initial decision was made in favor of HP. Case No. 1-11-CV-203163. 2015: Oracle appealed, quickly denied by 6th District Court of Appeal, ordering Oracle to pay $3 billion to HP. Case No H039507. ● Are two contracts related? ○ Yes. Although the written settlements were mostly about Huld himself, it does not change the fact that the two companies made reaffirmations to their partnerships. ○ [ HP platforms ] include Itanium. ● Did HP break its duty first? ○ HP secretly paid Intel $690 million to keep production till 2017. ○ False marketing. However, HP only promised to keep its products compatible with Oracle software. Still valid. Economics analysis: ● Expected damage too high: ○ Market uncertainty: not entirely Oracle’s fault. ○ Revenue $500 million × 6 years = $3 billion? HP didn’t lose all the sales immediately. "]
