["Kou 1 Zhitao Kou Instructor: XXXXXX Writing 2 Section 1800 23 April 2018 Empowering Colleges with VR: What Can It Bring? College education is already worth a lot for most students. Data from Bureau of Labor Statistics prove that a bachelor’s degree in college yields more than 1 million dollars through a graduate’s whole life, and that’s a giant number (Zach, How Much Are Good Grades Worth?”). Colleges used a lot of new ideas and technologies to achieve such great results. For example, UC Santa Barbara, currently ranked as 11th best value school in U.S. (Susan et al., “America's Best Value Colleges 2018”), provides students with unlimited access to scholar databases all over the world, millions of the books across all UC libraries, advanced websites to provide campus-wide communications and knowledge sharing, fully equipped labs with modern softwares and so on. The combination of talent professors and latest technologies enhance the learning experience in UCSB to a high level. In the future, it will be possible for UCSB and other colleges to adopt new technologies to further improve the learning productivities. One potential example is Virtual Reality technology, which allows people to see a different world through a portable gadget. By bringing in VR devices, schools will be able to provide better education on many areas of study. First, VR technology is a perfect fit for art and media studies. By wearing the VR gadgets along with trackable gloves, students will be able to step into a world where they can build skyscrapers and paint artworks similar to the real world. An architecture-major student may find ","Kou 2 it extremely helpful. When he wants to build a skyscraper in New York city for his class project, he does not need to be physically presented in New York city to understand the streets and buildings. It is possible to gather all the materials in the virtual world and put it right inside the city to discover the overall look. In addition, art-major students will be able to visit the world’s best art museums without leaving the campus, as well as travelling to different places for inspiration. In this case, VR devices help college student create a pathway to the resources all over the world and let them learn knowledge better. Besides, there is also a growing need for film and theater major students to get a hands-on experiences with VR filming. Watching a VR video is more immersed than a regular movie, and it may become the mainstream media in the future. VR movie allows the audience to be part of the movie, walking along and see the events closely. When actors are fighting, the audience will feel the knives and see the blood all around them; when actors are falling, the audience will see the approaching ground as well. Filming a VR movie is different from other kinds of movies, which requires filmmakers to shoot 360-degree movies with specially designed cameras. Thus, it requires students to learn more about new devices so that they can be more competitive in the future job market. Second, VR technology is also a tool to connect students with professors who live away from campus. Best professors and researchers are rare, and they can be hardly found all together at a single college. If some students want to learn a cutting-edge technology from a professor of other college, they are out of luck. Despite there are some professors who already put their lecture videos online, the lack of interactive elements make these videos hard to follow: A lot of students lost focus after couple hours of studying. According to an article on New York Times, ","Kou 3 the lack of interactive elements makes online courses “nothing you could get from that course that you couldn’t get from a good book on the subject” (Mark, “The Trouble With Online Education”). However, if both professors and students can join the same classroom virtually with the help of VR gadgets, they will be able to see each other and figure out what to discuss in the course. In this case, VR technology helps bring the academic world closer, which will present the world with better innovations in the future. Even if VR classrooms cannot be used for cross-campus activities in the short time, it is a smart decision to have it in stock for every college in case of extreme situations. For example, on December 4, 2017, a huge fire affected the Ventura county, known as the “Thomas Fire”. During the wildfire, the route from Santa Barbara to Ventura and Los Angeles was cut off. A great amount of UCSB professors who live outside Santa Barbara county found it impossible to make it to the school and thus canceled class. In such cases, if they had VR technology on hand, it would be possible for them to continue their regular class as if nothing happened. They can quickly create a VR room to exactly match the physical classroom and start the class as usual, instead of canceling classes and wasting a lot of time. Students are also benefited from using VR devices at home instead of going to school, given that the outdoor air quality during the Thomas Fire is near unbreathable. Last but not least, VR is also a technology that can be used to decrease stress level for students. From earlier days, VR was already used to treat PTSD, or Post traumatic stress disorder, and help people to deal with stress treatments. In colleges, although most students do not have serious disorders, it is still a good choice for them to have VR to help them relax. For example, some students, who have homesick when they first comes to college, may find it ","Kou 4 helpful to have a VR room filled with their childhood belongings in order to sleep better. While other students may just find it relieving to play some VR games during class breaks. A huge selection of options to improve in life quality are already under development today. For example, every VR device comes with a special version of Netflix, which allows you to sit in a theater and watch movies and TVs in a giant high-quality screen instead of a small laptop screen in college dorms; VR games like “Smash Hit” give people vivid feelings of breaking glasses and reduce stress levels. There are countless VR solutions for the student to live easier and study happier. In conclusion, Virtual Reality technology is so useful. It can be incorporated into college lives with many benefits. These benefits include being more creative, learning better, communicating easier, studying happier. As VR devices are starting to drop prices down to a reasonable level, it is definitely an option worth considering for college’s board of directors to further improve their school education, as well as increasing the value of college education for all students.
