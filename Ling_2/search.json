["Kou 1 Zhitao Kou Lecturer XXX Linguistic 3C (Section 4) 26 May 2016 Economic Outlook: Why Americans Are Concerned Has the U.S. economy really slowed down? Many Americans now tend to believe that the country is experiencing a difficult time finding the next opportunity to further promote the economy. People believe that America can no longer lead the world ’s economy, and it faces challenges from fast developing countries like China and India which may take over the American economy. Many citizens hold negative attitudes toward the future the U.S. economy. A survey from The New York Times called “Economic Outlook” collects a huge set of publi c opinions about the future economy. The concern of the survey respondents towards the future weak American economy is proven to be true because of the broken social compact and the increasing job instability. The broken social compact in the U.S. can be shown from the distrust of the government and the worries for the future generation, and both of them will hurt the future U.S. economy. Many Americans believe that the social compact is no longer attractive enough to motivate them to work hard, and their negative working attitudes hurt the U.S. economy. Based on its definition, the social compact is that people used to believe if they work hard, their government will make sure that they will have wonderful lives and better opportunities for their children. However, according to the “Economic Outlook” survey, many Americans no longer believe in the government to secure the social compact, which explains the reason why some people do not have high willingness to contribute to the economy. To illustrate, a woman in her 40s feels ","Kou 2 annoyed about the economy next year because “it's abhorrent that polarized politicians and pundits have sabotaged the livelihood of so many hardworking citizens. ” The thought can be also found in other age groups. A man in his 20s also shows his helplessness about the future economy because “ it's clear that corporations own the government. ” Both of these respondents show concerns that the government is not run by trustworthy people, which decreases the trust between the government and the respondents. The motivation of working hard gets lower since people do not believe that the government has kept its promises in the past and will not keep them in the future. According to President Barack Obama , in the late 70s “technology made it easier for companies to do more with less job occupations,” and “a more competitive world lets companies shipping certain jobs anywhere” (para. 11). During that period of time, there was a clear indication that the unemployment rate was going to increase dramatically, but the government did nothing effective to slow down the trend. Based on this history, it makes people wonder if the government is controlled by large corporations instead of elected politicians who care about their people, which corresponds to the previous comments in the “Economic Outlook” survey. It is clear that people cannot work in support of the economy moving forward if they do not trust the government. The broken social compact between the government and its citizens create a trust gap that the two groups can no longer work together to boost the U.S. economy. Besides blaming the government, the broken social compact can also be shown in the negative opinions through future generation’s job prospects. The hope for future generations is essential to the social compact because everyone loves their children, and people will easily give up on themselves if they know they cannot make a single improvement to their children even if they work hard. According to the “Economic Outlook” survey, a man in his 60s feel discouraged about the n ext generation’s job prospects b ecause “ it is going to take a decade before the ","Kou 3 economy can recover enough to reach good employment prospects. ” A similar attitude is shown in older age groups as well, a woman in her 80s feel concerned because “ my son is doing an assortment of low level jobs with little chance of getting back to employment even near his skills. ” Both of these two respondents express their worries about their children and feel the broken social compact. Globalization is one of the main reasons that create potential risks for the future generations, which will break the social compact and discourage economic productivity. The problem becomes worse when the weak U.S. economy cannot create enough job positions. According to U.S. News and World Report , the U.S. has only an average of 2.1% annual growth rate while fast-growing countries like China has an average growth rate around 6 to 7 percent (para.8). There are always more entrepreneurial opportunities in areas with a higher rate of economic growth. As an example, a company may find it hard to gain more contracts in the U.S., but it can easily achieve its target by going to a new market where there are uncountable demands for new construction. Companies will leave the U.S. and hire people in other countries instead, which will lower the willingness of working for parent workers. The nation cannot improve its economy without contributions from every citizen, unless it chooses to rebuild its social compact. In addition to the broken social compact, the instability of the job market also justifies the concern for the U.S. economy. Public opinion now strongly supports the idea that the current job market is not helpful to the ec onomy. According to the “Economic Outlook” Survey, a man in his 20s feel scared about the future job status because “We all don’t know what thi s crisis is really about, people were in the same position a s 1929.” To illustrate, he believes the current job market is similar to the Great Depression that happened last century, and people will lose their ","Kou 4 jobs accompanied by the crash of the economy. Another unemployed woman in her 40s shares a similar attitude towards the job market and the economy. She feels disgusted because “ the global economy was hijacked by parasites, and won't recover for at least a decade .” Besides, a man in his 60s feels angry on the shortage of job positions “Because the rich who control the jobs are traitorously sending jobs overseas.” All these three people show their opinions that the U.S job market is instable, and the future economy is going to crash. The future economy and the job market that the survey respondents describe have a direct relationship with each other. The productivity of the nation will be lower if there are too many unemployed workers in the society, and a lower productivity will bring down the economy. Simply put, employed workers can produce goods for the economy. The more workers become unemployed, the lower the nation’s productivity will be. However, there are now more workers that choose not to look for a job. According to the Bureau of Labor Statics, the current Labor Force Participation Rate is only 62.8 percent, which is the lowest number since the 1980s (para. 1). The data shows that about only six out of ten people have the willingness to work, while the remaining possible labor choose to stay at home. The low number of Labor Force Participation Rate shows that the current economy situation discourages a lot of people from going to work, which corresponds to the previous comments in the “Economic Outlook” survey that the U.S. economy may have a financial crisis soon. In addition to the traditional unemployment, the economic crisis also leads to underemployment, which means high-level workers cannot find jobs that match their abilities. According to author Stephen Marche, “the majority of new college grads in the United States are either unemployed or working jobs that don’t require a degree” (para. 7). A waste of students’ knowledge is also a waste of population productivity, which will bring down the U.S. economy. ","Kou 5 Furthermore, most college students graduate with debt as high as $27,200 (para. 7). The combination of high debt and underemployment with low wages will destroy the current working generation and lead to a much weaker economy. In sum, the U.S. economy has slowed down over the last few years, which are the results from both the broken social compact and the increasing job instability. The concerns of the respondents from the “Economic Outlook” survey cannot be ignored since discouraged respondents will have lower working productivity and hurt the economy. The U.S. government has to find a solution to regain people’s trust and buil d a better nation for everyone.
