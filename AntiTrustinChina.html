The Chinese antitrust law was young and a lot of decisions raised further debates by the public.

The paper concluded that such decision was reasonable yet questionable, because it involved government interests that would affect equal judgements.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c13">1.0 Introduction</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualcomm Incorporated is a San Diego based company focused in building chips that are made for devices of any kind to connect to the internet. Qualcomm is one of the major patient holders for CDMA, WCDMA, LTE technologies, commonly known as 2G, 3G, and 4G networks. These technologies are widely used for people around the world to communicate with each other. There is no exception in China, seeing that most phones are powered by Qualcomm modem, the technological term used to describe the wireless internet component. After a 14 months&rsquo; investigation from November 2013 to February 2015, the Chinese Government Agency &ldquo;National Development and Reform Commission&rdquo; (NDRC) believed that Qualcomm violated the antitrust law for its abuse in dominance of the modem market, giving a fine of equivalent 975 million U.S. dollars</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt1" id="ftnt_ref1">[1]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">However, since Chinese government often made its decisions based on the theory of building &ldquo;stability and harmonious society&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt2" id="ftnt_ref2">[2]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;rather than make equal law enforcements, the decision may not be convincible, given previous decisions regarding Coca-Cola&rsquo;s acquisition of Huiyuan. This paper will talk about how Chinese government proved its claim and discuss whether such evidence is efficient to conclude Qualcomm&rsquo;s abuse in dominance.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c13">2.0 Background Knowledge</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.1 Qualcomm Inc. Business</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The San Diego semiconductor giant Qualcomm, founded in 1985, &nbsp;is considered one of the largest semiconductor manufacturers in world. It generates its revenue from selling: 1. mobile modems, which are used to connect to mobile internet operators; 2. &ldquo;system on chip&rdquo; (SOCs), which is a combination of most popular cell phone parts including modem, computing, Bluetooth, WiFi, Image Processing Unit and so on; 3. licensing its patents to mobile phone manufacturers who are normally referred as &ldquo;Original Equipment Manufacturers&rdquo; (OEMs). A great amount of Qualcomm&rsquo;s patent holdings are considered &ldquo;standards-essential patents&rdquo; (SEPs) which are necessary for mobile devices to connect to the network operators especially CDMA-based networks, examples include Verizon (US), Sprint (US), China Telecom and so on</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt3" id="ftnt_ref3">[3]</a></sup><span class="c1">. These SEPs are so important and make Qualcomm benefit a lot from collecting patent fees. Historically, Qualcomm has retained its price of patents to be 5% of the product&rsquo;s selling price, meaning a $649 iPhone or a $199 low-cost phone have to pay Qualcomm a patent fee of $32.45 or $9.95, respectfully. The patent fee is charged regardless what chips are used inside the phone, since Qualcomm never licensed its patents to its competitors thus all patents fees have to go directly from OEMs to Qualcomm. To ensure collecting the payments, Qualcomm&rsquo;s law division and sales division join together to insist a &ldquo;no license no chips&rdquo; policy to OEMs</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt4" id="ftnt_ref4">[4]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Such actions are often considered &ldquo;tax&rdquo; by the general public, since the patent payment is both &ldquo;inevitable&rdquo; and &ldquo;reflect on selling price&rdquo;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.2 Mobile phone modem market</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wireless communication in fact has a lot of different standards with the improvements from generation to generation. In China, the most common used second-generation (2G) standards include GSM and CDMA, third-generation (3G) standards include WCDMA, CDMA2000, and TD-SCDMA, and fourth-generation (4G) standards include LTE-TDD and LTE-FDD. Different generations of wireless standards are considered complementary to ensure smooth upgradation, and it is necessary for network operators to have compatible switches from one certain generation to a corresponding other. The market of </span><span class="c1">modems</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;also include the market of SOCs, since OEMs are wishing to purchase more components from one distributor in order to decrease the overall size of its final product. In both situations, Qualcomm is the significant market leader with high consumer satisfaction.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.3 Mobile phone market</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After purchasing modems, OEMs are heading to make fully functioned cell phones. In China, the mobile phone market is under massive competition between international firms like Apple and Samsung and domestic firms like Xiaomi, Huawei, Lenovo, Coolpad and so on. Except for Apple, most companies are producing their phones using Android operation system, an open-source project created by Google, which accounts for more than 80% of market share</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt5" id="ftnt_ref5">[5]</a></sup><span class="c0">. These Chinese firms are considered low in patent holdings and rely on international suppliers to make the product. For example, they may all use Qualcomm processor, LG screens, and Sony cameras. Although there are multiple chip manufacturers besides Qualcomm available in the market, real choices are limited. For example, Samsung Exynos and Huawei HiSilicon only ships with their own phones, and MediaTek mainly focused on low-end products with limited computing power. This situation left the majority of Android smartphones no choice except to stick with Qualcomm. Since the differences between them are not significant, lack of essential patent holdings makes Chinese firms struggling in negotiating with international firms while keeping their price down to average marginal cost. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.4 The Chinese Antitrust Law</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The law, released on 2007 and effective 2008, is one of the youngest antitrust law in the world. It defines the law closer to the European standards and prohibits the &ldquo;abuse in dominance&rdquo; to ensure the market efficiency. The Chinese government defines &ldquo;abuse&rdquo; to be selling at a price too high, or selling way too cheap, as well as selling with unreasonable trading conditions. The law also has policies regarding merger control and monopoly agreements.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt6" id="ftnt_ref6">[6]</a></sup></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">After the publish of the law, it raised a lot of worries by the general public. Given the fact that half of the big companies in China are state-owned companies, the targets of the antitrust law are more likely to be few private Chinese companies and a lot of foreign companies. The Chinese way of law enforcement makes it easy to contract a bias. The authorities will choose cases to investigate and make their decisions first. In the process of selecting targets, it is possible for them to be more biased toward foreign companies due to nationality, though they do work on both domestic and international cases. Examples include Chinese alcohol makers Wuliangye and Maotai, and even state-owned telecom companies China Telecom and China Unicom.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">However, targeting certain Chinese firms does not clear the doubts for foreign companies. Foreign targets include auto groups in German, software giant Microsoft, and other multinational corporations. Despite these companies have existing lawsuits that may guide the Chinese authorities to start investigation, a lot of high profile Chinese cases just walked away with a easy yes. In the year 2015 alone, there are at least five major mergers include 1. Ridesharing apps: DiDi and Kuaidi; 2. Chinese version of craigslist: 58 and Ganji; 3. Chinese version of Yelp and Groupon: Dianpng and Meituan; 4. Hotel &amp; flights booking websites: Ctrip and Qunar; 5. Dating website: Baihe and Shijijiayuan.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt7" id="ftnt_ref7">[7]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;These cases would normally experience a mass investigation in most other countries but made its merger quick and easy in China. It raised the question in what purposes are Chinese government using the antitrust law to achieve.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.5 Previous decision regarding Coca-Cola&rsquo;s acquisition of Huiyuan</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ministry of Commerce, or MOFCOM, is another Chinese government agency that holds the antitrust power against merges and acquisition. After one month of effective of Chinese antitrust law, government started its investigation for its first ever antitrust action. It ruled out that the acquisition of Huiyuan by Coca-Cola, the popular Chinese juice brand and the American soda giant, to be illegal. The government said that it gave Coca-Cola too much market power by combining Chinese juice brand Huiyuan and its own juice brand Minute Maid. Given the fact the Coca-Cola had a significant market share in a related soft drink market, the MOFCOM believed that Coca-Cola would have the enough market power thus sell drinks in bundle to eliminate competitors and hurt consumers</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt8" id="ftnt_ref8">[8]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The MOFCOM decision was so controversial that contained a lot of debates. First, the government concluded that Coca-Cola will sell bundles without any convincible evidence. Second, the relative market for drinks can also include teas, coffees, milk drinks, sport drinks and so on. Only calculating the markets for soda and juice will put Coca-Cola a bad position in determining market power. Third, the government may make its decision based on the policy of keeping country stable rather than make justice law enforcements. Based on the online poll of more than 76,000 internet users, more than 80% of them were opposing the deal</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt9" id="ftnt_ref9">[9]</a></sup><span class="c0">. The government might fear that approving the deal would make doubts to its citizens as well as weaken Chinese power in global competition.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on this decision, the global society worried that the Chinese government may use the law against foreign companies while protecting its own economy. It also raised the doubts for further antitrust decisions.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">2.6 Qualcomm lawsuits, Globally</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a company that charges a high patent fee globally, Qualcomm is also facing antitrust lawsuits from other countries. In the U.S., the early case can be traced back to 2006, when Broadcomm sued Qualcomm for monopolizing conduct by not licensing patents to its rivals.

Most data will be drawn from NDRC decisions as well as Qualcomm reports. The paper also includes additional data from reliable sources to further illustrate NDRC decisions. Some data come from sources related to other Qualcomm lawsuits. Examples include public information released by Federal Trade Commission (FTC) in U.S., and only the sources helpful to understand the Chinese case will be included. To discuss the legitimate reason behind the NDRC decision, this paper also include some other Chinese government decisions as well.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c13">3.0 Findings</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.1 Qualcomm modem market share</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">Qualcomm, as the major inventor of CDMA network from last century and continues developments over the years, owns significant amount of patents in CDMA, WCDMA, and LTE technologies. According to the data from Strategy Analytics conducted in 2013, which is also quoted in NDRC decisions, Qualcomm has a revenue-based market share of 93.1% in CDMA markets, 53.9% in WCDMA markets, and 96% in LTE markets. Qualcomm has a significant market share, defined as a share of greater than 50%, in all these three markets. In addition, rivals are usually small and extremely low in market share. In CDMA market, the only rival is VIA Telecom with a market share fewer than 7%; In WCDMA market, the next three rivals are MediaTek (15.5%), Intel (11.8%), and Broadcom (9.3%); In LTE market, the second largest rival Samsung only has a market share of 2%</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt15" id="ftnt_ref15">[15]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.2 Qualcomm revenues as a tax</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main argument between Qualcomm and other companies is whether or not the 5% &ldquo;Qualcomm tax&rdquo; is legitimate. It&rsquo;s charges its price based on the selling price of the product, which means that a portion of the technologies that have no relations with Qualcomm are also charged. Similar arguments can be found in Apple Inc. statements, saying &ldquo;(Qualcomm) has nothing do with the display or the Touch ID or a gazillion other innovations that Apple has done&rdquo;</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt16" id="ftnt_ref16">[16]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Mathematically, a Qualcomm modem only costs around 15 U.S. dollars, while the patent charge is above 30 dollars. It makes the public believe that the patent charge may be so high that it draws patent fees from other components.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">The other question is whether the 5% charge so high, given that Qualcomm never provides a full list of its standards-essential patents and non standards-essential patents which are included in the payment. The first commercial use of CDMA technology was as early as 1995, while a part of Qualcomm patents has expired under the 20-years limit. It is questionable that if the Qualcomm patents fee is still as valuable as it was before. Qualcomm argues that the company also have been adding new patents to the portfolio in order to make the patent fee remains to be 5%.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.3 Qualcomm&rsquo;s &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualcomm has another theory for its patent fees. In practice, Qualcomm may ask the contractor to license its related patent holdings back to Qualcomm for free</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt17" id="ftnt_ref17">[17]</a></sup><span class="c0">, as well as give up the rights to sue other Qualcomm clients. In the process of exchanging patents, Qualcomm does not take into consideration the value of the clients&rsquo; patents, neither pay nor make discount for the clients. Under the pressure of Qualcomm&rsquo;s &ldquo;no patent no chip&rdquo; policy, most OEMs agreed to these terms. By distributing these terms, Qualcomm lowered the barriers for the OEM market. Such actions are often considered an &ldquo;umbrella&rdquo; of protection to Qualcomm clients, especially small clients. Since small firms will not be sued by large companies for intellectual properties as long as they pay for Qualcomm, making a cell phone brand is so easy that a lot of new firms entry. For example, Cui Jian, a Chinese singer, released his own named smartphone in April 2013. Fu Rong Jie Jie, an internet celebrity and actor, released his own named smartphone in August 2013. Han Geng, a Chinese actor, released his own named smartphone in November 2013. Despite these phones did not sell well, it demonstrates the idea of low entry barriers for smartphone market. Exceptions of these examples include Luo Yonghao, a popular English teacher, created his smartphone company &ldquo;smartisan&rdquo; and received a limited success because of his obsessed attitudes toward industrial design.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.4 Qualcomm&rsquo;s actions toward competitors</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Qualcomm&rsquo;s &ldquo;no patent no chips&rdquo; policy makes it hard for OEMs to not sign for the contract. In addition, there is no way for OEMs to get the same SEPs from Qualcomm&rsquo;s rivals, since Qualcomm refused to license its patents to competitors. In order to release its products and avoid lawsuits, OEMs have to sign licensing terms directly with Qualcomm, meaning a 5% Qualcomm is inevitable.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To better protect Qualcomm&rsquo;s business, the company once signed a five-year exclusive supply terms with Apple Inc in exchange for lowered patent rates</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt18" id="ftnt_ref18">[18]</a></sup><span class="c0">, rumored to $10 per device. Apple Inc. is such a large client that small firms may grow fast with Apple&rsquo;s business.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.5 NDRC decisions</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After the fourteen month investigation, NDRC officially published its decision in 2015. Key solutions include</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt19" id="ftnt_ref19">[19]</a></sup><span class="c0">:</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">1. In the process of licensing, Qualcomm has to provide a full list of patents without any expired patents.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">2. Qualcomm has to respect the willingness of the OEMs and should not require to license patents back to Qualcomm without a price.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">3. Qualcomm&rsquo;s patent will no longer calculated as a percentage of the total selling price. Instead, the price is calculated as 5% of the 65% of the selling price of a CDMA-included phone and 3,5% of the 65% for a LTE-only phone.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">4. Qualcomm cannot force OEMs to sign SEPs and non-SEPs as a required bundle. Further negotiating is necessary for both parties to determine what patens should be included.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">5. Qualcomm cannot force a &ldquo;no patent no chips&rdquo; policy without the right from OEMs to challenge the terms.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">6. The fine is equal to 8% of Qualcomm&rsquo;s 2013 revenue in China, which is 6.088 billion CNY, or approximately 975 million USD. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">3.6 Public Reactions</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">On February 10th, 2015, Qualcomm (QCOM) </span><span class="c1">Stock price jumped for more than 2.8%</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt20" id="ftnt_ref20">[20]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Most stockholders considered it a positive signal to future Qualcomm business. It cleared out future uncertainties for Qualcomm China, which accounts for about half of its total revenue. Furthermore, Chinese agency also told the general public that Qualcomm cooperate well with the government, which made it an example of positive government relationship. The decisions also gave Qualcomm freedom to conduct additional talks with OEMs, which may lead to a greater profits with the growing of Qualcomm patents.</span></p><p class="c3 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c13">4.0 Discussions</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.1 Is Qualcomm a dominant firm?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine whether or not Qualcomm had abused its dominance, the first step is to check if Qualcomm is the dominant firm. In Section 4 Article 19 of the Chinese antitrust law, it states that a dominant market role is defined by a market share of more than 50%</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt21" id="ftnt_ref21">[21]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Based on the findings of Qualcomm&rsquo;s market share, its dominance role can be found in the three sub markets of wireless technology: CDMA, WCDMA, and LTE markets, with a market share of 93.1%, 53.9%, and 96%, respectively.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1">To further illustrate Qualcomm&rsquo;s dominance position, NDRC also used Section 4 Article 18 of the antitrust law. In part 4 and part 5 of the Article 18, law states a dominant position should be determined by verifying how rivals rely on these products as well as the entry barriers for the market</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt22" id="ftnt_ref22">[22]</a></sup><span class="c0">. It turned out that Qualcomm&rsquo;s every SEP is so important that every rival would rely on it in order to be working on the same wireless standard. The entry barriers were also high, since new firms have to have a large portfolio of SEPs to avoid lawsuits from existing players. By looking at these two facts, NDRC further concluded Qualcomm&rsquo;s dominant position.</span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c0">Qualcomm agreed with the method to define the submarket while raised one opposition. According to Qualcomm, the market share is calculated based on revenue, but Qualcomm would have less than 50% market share in WCDMA market if calculated with units sold. NDRC said that it appreciated Qualcomm&rsquo;s opinion, but NDRC believed such data further proved Qualcomm&rsquo;s dominance, since it revealed Qualcomm&rsquo;s price power over other rivals.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.2 Has Qualcomm abused its dominance?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chinese antitrust law has specific definitions toward the action of abuse. In Section 4 Article 17, it lists 7 actions which are violations of the law. The two violations that are mentioned to Qualcomm case are part 1 and part 5, saying it is illegal to sell at an unfair high price and illegal to sell with unfair condition.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To determine these actions, NDRC compared Qualcomm actions with the law. First is the part one of the article regarding the patent fee price. NDRC believed that Qualcomm did not provide enough evidence to justify that Qualcomm did not charge expired patents in its 5% portfolio. It is unfair to ask OEMs to pay for expired patents. Although Qualcomm argued that it had been adding new patents to keep the portfolio to maintain the 5% price, NDRC believed that Qualcomm failed to provide evidence to justify that new patents are as valuable as expired patents</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt23" id="ftnt_ref23">[23]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Regarding part 5 of the article, NDRC concluded that Qualcomm had multiple violations</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt24" id="ftnt_ref24">[24]</a></sup><span class="c0">. First, Qualcomm made OEMs sign for contracts that bundled both SEPs and non-SEPs to get a higher payment, which is illegal under the Chinese antitrust law. Second, it is illegal to force companies to sign unfair conditions by threating with the dominant market power. Qualcomm&rsquo;s conditions required OEMs to license their relative patents back to Qualcomm, mostly for free. NDRC believed that such actions breach the willingness of the OEMs, and no company is willing to give up the rights of their valuable patents. Third, Qualcomm used a &ldquo;no patent no chip&rdquo; policy to threat the OEMs to sign the contract, which was a clear example of using dominant power to hurt other companies.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Based on all these abuses, NDRC concluded Qualcomm violate the antitrust law and imposed a fine of $975 million, or 8% of Qualcomm&rsquo;s annual revenue in China in 2013</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt25" id="ftnt_ref25">[25]</a></sup><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.3 Is the fine high?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mathematically, the Qualcomm fines seem to be very high. It was indeed the highest fine ever as an antitrust case in Chinese history. However, in the process of making the decision, the Chinese government put considerations and lowered the outcome rates. First, it offered 2% discount for the fine, which could be as high as 10% of the annual revenue. Second, in Section 7 Article 47, the law did not state whether the 10% fine is calculated by regional or global revenue.</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt26" id="ftnt_ref26">[26]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;The fine would be twice high if the fine is calculated by global revenue, given Chinese revenue accounts for half of Qualcomm&rsquo;s income. Third, the fine seemed to be more reasonable when compared to fines imposed by Taiwan and South Korea. These two regions have a relatively much smaller markets than China, each accounts for around 10% to 20% of Qualcomm total revenue. However, their fine ended up to be $774 million and $853 million, which is less than 20% decrease than Chinese fines. By comparison, NDRC fines seemed to be smaller than any other country&rsquo;s.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.3 Consumer Harm</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;NDRC did not include many words on the topic of consumer harm, except for the argument of innovation. By licensing related patents back to Qualcomm, these contracts will discourage OEMs from making new innovations. NDRC believed that lacking of new improvements for the products can be a consumer harm in long run</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt27" id="ftnt_ref27">[27]</a></sup><span class="c0">. However, Qualcomm will invest its profits into research and bring new innovations to benefit consumers. Such consumer harm is hard to prove.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The existence of consumer harm is more likely to be reflected on the smartphone selling price. Qualcomm&rsquo;s patent fee apply like a tax, which will draw price up and reduce quantity. Although some international giants like Apple and Samsung may decide to internalize the Qualcomm tax into its cost to promote quantity sold, most Chinese firms who are selling at the marginal cost have no ability to do so. Thus, Qualcomm&rsquo;s patent fee would have a direct influence over the market price and create a consumer harm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.5 Counterarguments for NDRC decision</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Despite NDRC had tried it best to provide best explanations of its decisions, there are still some unclear points that may exclude Qualcomm from being convicted.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First, Qualcomm has been setting its patent fees to be 5% for a long history of time. Regardless what NDRC argued that Qualcomm&rsquo;s new patents may not be as valuable as expired patents, it is possible for the new patents to worth more than the old patents. Seeing increasing number of people to use smartphones, Qualcomm technologies are playing a more important role in the current world. In this case, Qualcomm set the price to be 5% only to decrease negotiation cost and promote efficiency with no overcharge at all.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Second, NDRC argued that OEMs were unwilling to license patents back to Qualcomm. However, with such exchanges of patents, signing a Qualcomm contract was an advantage for OEMs. It will clear the legal concerns and let OEMs more focused in building great products. Xiaomi, which is now a Chinese smartphone giant, once experienced massive lawsuit from Ericsson when entered Indian market. The selling was temporarily banned until Qualcomm showed up. It turned out all patents that Ericsson sued Xiaomi for were licensed by Qualcomm</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt28" id="ftnt_ref28">[28]</a></sup><span class="c0">. There are a lot of examples showing the benefits of Qualcomm&rsquo;s contracts, and OEMs are willing to exchange the patents to grow the overall Qualcomm&rsquo;s patent pool.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There were much more evidences to come. Qualcomm might be able to fight for its rights with the law, but it did not choose to do so. It raised the question on the real purpose of this NDRC decision.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">4.6 Possible explanations</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A number of Chinese government cases are decided on the basis of build &ldquo;stability and harmonious society&rdquo; </span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt29" id="ftnt_ref29">[29]</a></sup><span class="c0">rather than make equal law judgements. In the process of building such society, the government values the potential benefits of executing its actions. To be specific, the government would reward the companies that boost economy and technology innovations in China, as well as punish the companies which take profits out of China and donate little.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The antitrust case for Qualcomm may be on the basis of same reason. The central government was aware Qualcomm&rsquo;s advanced position in global technology and wished Qualcomm to give something back. One significant example is the cooperation between Qualcomm and Zhongxin, a Chinese semiconductor manufacturer who had limited power in global competition. With the help from Qualcomm, Zhongxin was able to being 28nm Wafer Production</span><sup class="c1"><a href="#ftnt30" id="ftnt_ref30">[30]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;in 2014. It is the technology that would take years for Zhongxin or any other Chinese firms to achieve. Since then, Qualcomm frequently appeared in Chinese press news and supported Chinese innovation similar to a local firm.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From most western views, such action is not fair in most cases. However, China, as a communist country, may still take more years to stop planning the economy and impose a free market. Before that day, it is possible to see more government decision with business trade-offs and limited legal senses.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c13">5.0 Limitations</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper comes with certain limitations. First, it was still far from gathering enough evidence to further prove its claim. Since the case was relatively new and government decisions were made privately, there were much more information yet to reveal. Second, the paper did not have enough room to discuss the relationship between Qualcomm Chinese case and all other case, which might lead to a more reliable result. In the future, as there will be more information to be released, it is possible to conclude an entirely different result.</span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c14 c13">6.0 Conclusion</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This paper talked about how Qualcomm Inc. generates its revenue and conduct business advantages. By analyzing these facts, the paper examined the Chinese NDRC decisions and believed that the NDRC decisions have reasonable claims while lack certain evidences in some parts. The overall fine was not high and had similar functions of a business trade-off. In short, the limitation of Chinese government made the Qualcomm case a reasonable reference but not 100% reliable to determine future lawsuits.</span></p><hr style="page-break-before:always;display:none;"><p class="c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c19"><span class="c0">Bibliography</span></p><p class="c8 c12"><span class="c1">&#25968;&#33521;&#32593;. &quot;&#12304;&#30424;&#28857;&#12305;2015&#24180;&#20114;&#32852;&#32593;&#34892;&#19994;&#20116;&#22823;&#21512;&#24182;&#26696; - &#25968;&#33521;.&quot; &#25968;&#33521;&#32593; DIGITALING.
